### Ti's Proposed Areas to cover a range of bouldering and sport climbing:
- Spray Wall: https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105816996/spray-wall (Bouldering v4-v12 and Sport 5.10a-5.14d) Shaded area.
- Springer Gulch Boulders: https://www.mountainproject.com/area/117023925/springer-gulch-bouldering (Just Bouldering, v2-v6) In the sun.
- Murray River Boulders: https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105745924/murray-boulders-river-boulders (Just Bouldering, v1-v5) In the sun.
- River Wall: https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105745361/river-wall (Just Sport, 5.9-5.12a and 1 v8) In the sun.

### File Description
This is mostly a breakdown of the boulders in the area and a recommendation of areas that have what everyone wants to do. I have the coordinates downloaded in advance but the Spray Boulder offers good sun protection for the first half of the day, and I imagine we will mess around in the water for a bit (or at least I will lol). This is to give you a general idea of what you may want to try/get psyched. But it will be a relaxed day (: Those who have sport gear please bring it, we will all meet at Springs Climbing Center on Saturday morning and figure out cars from there. I will cover the entrance fee, but I do need to know if we are taking more than 2 cars in advance (i.e. do I need $20 or $30 of cash on hand).

**Try to bring**: Sunscreen, climbing shoes, chalk, sport gear (harness and ropes if you have them), (I will bring 3 bouldering pads and James will bring 2), shoes that can go in the water, and a waterbottle. The bugs aren't that bad so you don't need bug spray unless you want to.


Here's the text message copy and pasted for those of you that clicked on the link and didn't actually read the essay that I wrote:

```
Hey guys, I finally got around to making the group chat- sorry to the people I told I was going to do this earlier
in the week and not sorry to the people I didn't actually overpromise to. 

We will be going to Eleven Mile Canyon this Saturday, August 5th. Hoping to get there around 11:30am and leave Scc by 10:30am.
(It's about an hour from Springs Climbing Center a.k.a. SCC)
We are going to all meet at SCC so we can get a proper headcount and hopefully only take 2 cars.
The entrance fee is $9 cash per car (3 cars * $9 = $27) to the canyon, so I will locate $30 prior to arrival.
- Meet at SCC at 10:30 am.
- Get to Eleven Mile by 11:30 am.
- Climb until roughly 5:00 pm or a little earlier.
- Eat at "The Fat BBQ Shack" which closes at 6:00 pm. Located at the entrance of the canyon. 38283 US-24, Lake George, CO 80827

Climbs: Spray wall (sport and boulder) for the times the temperatures will be hottest.
The spray wall is in the shade and right next to water. Bring shoes or something you're comfortable messing around the water in. 

Car: 3 cars that are taking 5 crash pads - sport gear, and 8 people. (I'll get $30 for the entrance fee).
People: Molly, Carson, Tristan, Elias, Luci, Nick, James, Ti.
```
